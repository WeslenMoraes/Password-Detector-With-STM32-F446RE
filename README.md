# Password-Detector-With-STM32-F446RE
This repositiry contains a very cool project of a Password Detector done with ARM-Cortex M4.

Hi Guys!

In this code I have the idea of practicing my skills about STM32 F446RE GPIO'S.
I made a Password Detector, inspired of my Digital Electronic classes in the 2 year of my technician course.
